# Virtual-Bidding
This repo is for my virtual bidding paper. I assume that the differences in electricity prices in the real-time market and day-ahead market follow Brownian motion with drift where the mean and volatility depend on today's weather. Therefore, I use a stochastic control approach to 
address the optimization problem faced by the virtual bidder, who needs to buy/sell and sell/buy the same amount of electricity at the same node, and profits from the price difference between the day-ahead and real-time market.
